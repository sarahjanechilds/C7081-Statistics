# C7081-Statistics
This is an assignment for class C7081 Statistical Analysis at Harper Adams University. 
The data are the well-known 1990 California house prices, choosen for not being too toy but also not being too cumbersome. The version used has been pre-cleaned and can also be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features  
The report looks at linear and multiple linear regression models to answer what factors most explain the median price of a house. It also looks at the spatial elements and autocorrelation, which violates iid assumptions of least squares, raising questions over the reliability of analysis that does not take it into account. A spatial regression model is attempted, then followed by tree based methods. 
The report is here presented as a QMD or via Google Colab - with the usual caveat of be aware and prepare for the load time for installing packages (if you guys know a work around to this, please let me know). The R script is also present.
