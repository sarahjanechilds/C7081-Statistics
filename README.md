This is an assignment for class C7081 Statistical Analysis at Harper Adams University. 
The data are the well-known 1990 California house prices, choosen for not being too toy but also not being too cumbersome. The version used has been pre-cleaned and can also be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features  
The report looks at linear and multiple linear regression models and then a random forest to answer what factors most explain the median price of a house 
The report is here presented as via Google Colab - with the usual caveat of be aware and prepare for the load time for installing packages (if you guys know a work around to this, please let me know). The R script is also present.
